Reverse string "JavaScript" manually (no .reverse()).

Given [1,2,3,4,5,6], return sum of numbers at only odd indexes.
(index 1 = 2, index 3 = 4, index 5 = 6 → sum = 12).

Merge two objects:
{a:1,b:2} and {b:3,c:4} → {a:1,b:3,c:4}.

From "I love coding in JS", return longest word.
→ "coding"

Rotate array [1,2,3,4,5] by 2 positions → [4,5,1,2,3].

Check if all elements in [2,4,6,8,10] are even → true.

From [false, 0, null, "", 5, "hi", undefined, NaN], remove falsy values.
→ [5,"hi"]

From [100,200,50,300,150], return the 2nd smallest number.
→ 100

Given {a:1, b:2, c:3}, invert keys and values → {1:"a", 2:"b", 3:"c"}.

From array [2,7,11,15] and target 9, return the pair [2,7].

Compress "aaabbbccdaa" → "a3b3c2d1a2".

Given [1,2,3,4,5], return array of factorials.
→ [1,2,6,24,120]

Count how many times each digit appears in 1122334455.
→ {1:2, 2:2, 3:2, 4:2, 5:2}

Reverse the order of characters in every word:
"I love JS" → "I evol SJ"

Multiply each element in [1,2,3,4] by its index.
→ [0,2,6,12]
