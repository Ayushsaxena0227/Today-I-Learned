ul — that’s a real‑world performance question every React dev has to master.
Let’s unpack it clearly and simply so you truly feel what happens when a component re‑renders, and how React.memo and useCallback help you stop the unneeded ones.

🧠 What’s actually happening
Whenever a parent component updates (state or props change), React re‑executes its function.
That means:

The parent returns new JSX.
Its children are created again in memory.
Unless React confirms they’re truly identical, it re‑renders them too.
If those children don’t visually change, those renders are wasted work = slower UI.

⚙️ 1️⃣ React.memo() → “skip render if props didn’t change”
React.memo wraps a component and tells React:

“If my props are the same as last time, don’t bother re‑rendering me.”

🧩 Example
React

import React from "react";

// Normal child, but wrapped with React.memo
const Child = React.memo(function Child({ value }) {
console.log("Child rendered!");
return <h3>Child Value: {value}</h3>;
});

export default function Parent() {
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

return (
<>
<Child value="static text" />
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment {count}</button>
</>
);
}
Each time you click the button, the parent updates.
✅ Without React.memo, the child re‑renders every time.
✅ With React.memo, since value is always the same (“static text”), the child skips rendering after the first time.

Console output:

text

Child rendered! ← once only
⚙️ 2️⃣ useCallback() → “keep the same function reference”
Here’s the often hidden problem:
If a parent passes a function prop, that function gets re‑created on every render, even if the logic inside didn’t change.

That new reference makes React.memo children think: “Ah! My prop changed!” → 👉 forces a re‑render again.

🧩 Example
Without useCallback:

React

function Parent() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const handleClick = () => console.log("clicked");

return (
<>
<Child onClick={handleClick} />
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
</>
);
}
Each parent re‑render creates a new handleClick function object → child re‑renders too.

✅ Fix: wrap it in useCallback so it keeps the same reference between renders (unless dependencies change).

React

const handleClick = useCallback(() => console.log("clicked"), []);
Now the child sees the same function reference and skips re‑rendering.

🧩 They become powerful together 💪
Tool What It Saves Works Best When
React.memo Prevents functional child component from re‑rendering when props haven’t changed Child receives simple data (props)
useCallback Prevents new function references between renders Parent passes callbacks to children
useMemo (bonus) Avoids recomputing expensive derived values You do heavy calculations inside components
🌟 Mini mental picture
Imagine React memoization like sticky notes:

🧠 React.memo: “Don’t redraw this sticky note unless the text changed.”
🧷 useCallback: “Don’t rewrite the pen that wrote this sticky note each time.”
Together, your UI stops wasting time redrawing things that are identical — all the speed, none of the noise.

✅ In one line
Use React.memo for child components,
and useCallback for functions passed down,
to make React skip unnecessary re‑renders and keep your app lightning‑fast.

// const str = "hi hello hi world hello";
// const SplitArr = str.split(" ").reduce((acc, word) => {
// acc[word] = (acc[word] || 0) + 1;
// return acc;
// // if(!acc[word]){
// // acc[word] = word;
// // return acc;
// // }
// }, {});
// console.log(SplitArr);
const str = "AAAbbCCaaD";
const frequency = {};
str
.toLowerCase()
.split("")
.forEach((ch) => {
frequency[ch] = (frequency[ch] || 0) + 1;
});
console.log(frequency );

What Is Hoisting — The Deep View
When JavaScript runs your code, it doesn’t execute line-by-line immediately. It goes through two main phases inside each execution context:

Creation Phase (aka: setup stage)
The engine scans all code before running it — it sets aside memory for variables and function declarations.

Function declarations are fully hoisted (their body is known).
var variables are hoisted but set to undefined.
let and const are hoisted too — but they live in the temporal dead zone until the engine actually reaches their line.
Execution Phase
The code actually runs, assigning values, calling functions, etc.

So, “hoisting” isn’t about physically moving code — it’s about when the engine makes things available in memory.

⚙️ Technical Animation of Hoisting
Take this example:

JavaScript

console.log(a); // ?
console.log(b); // ?
console.log(c); // ?

var a = 10;
let b = 20;
function c() {
return 30;
}
During the creation phase, JS performs something like this (simplified mental model):

JavaScript

var a = undefined; // memory reserved
// let b; — reserved, but not usable yet (TDZ)
function c() { return 30; } // function stored fully
Now, execution phase starts — line by line:

console.log(a) → outputs undefined → because a exists but isn’t assigned yet.
console.log(b) → ❌ throws “ReferenceError” → because we’re still in TDZ for b.
console.log(c) → logs function definition → because full function is already loaded.
Assign a = 10; and b = 20;.
Done.
🧍‍♂️ Layman’s Analogy: The Stage Manager
Imagine a play rehearsal.
Before actors perform (execution), the stage manager walks through the script (creation):

She reserves a spot on stage for each actor’s name (var variables → empty chairs with name tags).
For some actors (let/const), she says “Don’t step on stage yet until I call you.”
For a few VIP routines (function declarations), she brings the whole routine ready to perform right from the start.
Then the show begins. The reserved chairs for var are empty (undefined) until the actor actually walks to it (assignment).

So when you call on them too early, you may see an empty chair (undefined) — or with let/const, the manager yells, “They’re not ready yet!” (TDZ error).

💡 Common Misconceptions
Hoisting doesn’t physically move code up; it’s just how memory is handled internally.
Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.
Function expressions and arrow functions behave like variables (hoisted as undefined or not accessible from TDZ).
en you double‑click a submit button, the browser fires the native onSubmit (or onClick) event twice.
So your handler runs twice → two API calls are sent → maybe two items get created in your database.

⚙️ 2️⃣ Simple preventive techniques
✅ Option A – Disable the button while submitting
This is the cleanest and most common fix.

React

import { useState } from "react";

export default function FormExample() {
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
e.preventDefault(); // stop browser’s default form reload
if (loading) return; // 👈 guard against double clicks

    setLoading(true);
    try {
      console.log("Submitting data...");
      await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 2000)); // simulate API
      alert("Submitted successfully");
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);             // re‑enable after completion
    }

};

return (
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
<input placeholder="Your name" />
<button type="submit" disabled={loading}>
{loading ? "Submitting..." : "Submit"}
</button>
</form>
);
}
🟢 Effect: Once you click “Submit,” the button disables immediately; any double‑clicks are ignored until the request finishes.

✅ Option B – Use flag inside handler (works with non‑button submit)
If disabling the element directly isn’t convenient (e.g., you submit programmatically), add an internal guard:

JavaScript

let submitting = false;

async function handleSubmit(e) {
e.preventDefault();
if (submitting) return; // stop 2nd run
submitting = true;

await doSomething();
submitting = false;
}
